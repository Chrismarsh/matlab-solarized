The Solarized Theme for Matlab
http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

Append the contents to your Matlab .prf configuration file and restart Matlab.

On Windows 7 this is at:

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\MathWorks\MATLAB\R20XX\matlab.prf

On OS X or Linux, this should be at

    ~/.matlab/R20XX/matlab.prf

where ``XX`` is your MATLAB version number.

Because Matlab doesn't offer highlighting rules for numbers, etc, this stays as close as possible to the Solarized theme.
